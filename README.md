## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I effectively utilized CSS custom properties (variables) to define and manage colors, font sizes, and other common stylistic values. This approach significantly streamlined the process of applying consistent styling across the components and made it incredibly easy to manage hover states by simply adjusting a variable value in one place.
